# stress_levels

## About 
This project gives an analysis of 2000 college students lifestyle habits and their corresponding stress levels, using various models. By leveraging machine learning models, the project identifies patterns in the data and predicts individual stress levels as either high, moderate, or low based on lifestyle habits.
## Goals 
Our goals for this project are: 
* exploring/analyzing the data set 
* recognizing/categorizing trends 
* implementing the model 
* refining the model for accuracy (stretch)
* implement a user interface (stretch)
## Process
Our process started with us analyzing the data and getting familiar with it. We started by writting some code to check the number of null cells and duplicate rows. We found no duplicates or null rows in our chosen data set, so we then procedeed to use a correlation matrix to find which of the other lifestyle variables is closely corrrelated with stress. We started with analyzing the data and recognizing any trends between certain habits and stress levels based on number of hours spent on each activity. We then used the given data set to train a model on predicting stress levels given a students lifestyle habits. The model then categorizes each individual into either high, low, or moderate stress level. 
## Models
We implemented both a decision tree and a support vector machine that allowed the model to categorize each individual.
