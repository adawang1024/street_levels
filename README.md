# stress_levels

## About 
This project gives an analysis of 2000 college students lifestyle habits and their correspinding stress levels, using various models. 
## Process
We started with analyzing the data and recongizing any trends between certain habits and stress level based on number of hours sepnt on each activity. We then used the given data set to train a model on predicting stress levels given a students lifestyle habits. The model then categorizes each individual into either high, low, or moderate stress level. 
## Models
We implemented both a decesion tree and a support vector machine that allowed the model to categorize each individual. 
## Goals 
Our goals for this project are: 
* exploring/analyzing the data set 
* recognzing/categorizing trends 
* implementing the model 
* refining the model for accuracy (stretch)
* implement a user interface (stretch)
